Hi again,

in case anybody tried to update the ECG-Eclipse-Plugin to 1.1.4
yesterday, please try again. Although the latest software version was
available at http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/ecg/update, the plug-in
reported itself as still being 1.1.3. If you already had 1.1.3
installed, Eclipse "thought" there was no new version available. Sorry
for that, it is fixed now.

Sebastian
