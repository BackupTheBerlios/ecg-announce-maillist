Subject: [Ecg-announce] New ECG release 1.1.0
Message-ID: <85D25331FFB7AE4C900EA467D4ADA39215555A@circle.pcpool.mi.fu-berlin.de>

Hi,

A new ECG release 1.1.0 is available at
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3356. Sorry,
but since we currently don't have an automatic support for change lists
per release, it won't list the numbers of bug fixes, enhancements, and
change revisions. 

In addition, we have a new update site
http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/ecg/update with contains the latest Eclipse
Sonsor with inline support.

Sebastian
