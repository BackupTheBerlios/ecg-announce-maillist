Subject: [Ecg-announce] ECG release 1.2 available
Message-ID: <B11A7FFF8FCDC14880468DC93015D7AC0C3C14@spree.pcpool.mi.fu-berlin.de>

A new ECG release 1.2 is available on BerliOS at
http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3356 as well
as on the Eclipse update site. 

Currently, http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/ecg/update doesn't seem to work,
use
http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-se/research/ecg/update or
http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-se/research/ecg2/update instead. The
update location "updatebeta" has been cancelled.

The ApplicationTitleLogger Sensor remains available at .../atl (instead
of .../update). The FocusTracker Sensor hasn't been updated as well; you
can still find the latest version at http://www.focustracker.org/update.

Change logs for ECG Sensor and Lab are attached. This release only
includes minor improvements. The change in minor release number (instead
of micro release number) is due to a changed naming scheme.

Cheers,
Sebastian
